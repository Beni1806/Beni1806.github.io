      <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Cannabis Legalization in Switzerland – Status in 2025</h2>

      <p>Switzerland is moving toward full cannabis legalization. After years of discussion and pilot studies, the federal government is actively working on a new legal framework for recreational cannabis use.</p>

      <h3>Draft Law and Key Proposals</h3>
      <p>In mid-2025, the Federal Council presented a draft law for public consultation. It proposes a regulated cannabis market with strict controls and health-oriented policies. Here are the key elements of the draft:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal age:</strong> Adults 18 and older can legally purchase and consume cannabis.</li>
        <li><strong>Licensed sales:</strong> Cannabis will be sold only in licensed shops under strict quality and safety rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Home cultivation:</strong> Allowed in limited quantities per person or household.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising ban:</strong> No advertising or promotion of cannabis products.</li>
        <li><strong>THC regulation:</strong> Products will include THC limits and mandatory health warnings on labels.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consultation Process</h3>
      <p>The draft law is currently under review. Political parties, cantons, health experts, and the public can submit feedback. Once the consultation phase ends, adjustments may be made before the law is debated in Parliament.</p>

      <p>If approved, the new law could come into effect by 2026 or 2027, replacing the current system where recreational cannabis is still illegal outside of medical or pilot study contexts.</p>

      <h3>Ongoing Pilot Projects</h3>
      <p>Several pilot projects are already underway in cities like Zurich, Basel, and Lausanne. These allow registered adults to legally buy and use cannabis for scientific research purposes. The goal is to better understand the social and health effects of legalization.</p>

      <p>Participants must live in the city running the study, be over 18, and pass a health check. These controlled environments help shape future nationwide policies.</p>

      <h3>Until Legalization Becomes Law</h3>
      <p>Until the new law passes, cannabis use remains mostly illegal. However, Switzerland has decriminalized the possession of small amounts (under 10 grams) for personal use. If you're caught, you'll usually face a fine of 100 CHF, and your cannabis will be confiscated.</p>

      <p>Any larger quantity, public use, dealing, or cultivation outside of pilot programs remains punishable by fines or criminal charges.</p>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>Switzerland’s new approach emphasizes safety, prevention, and education. The proposed legalization is not just about legal access—it includes public health campaigns, youth protection, and data-driven policy making.</p>
