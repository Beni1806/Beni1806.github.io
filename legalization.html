      <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Current Cannabis Legalization Status in Switzerland</h2>

      <p>In 2025, Switzerland is taking major steps toward legalizing cannabis. After years of pilot projects and debates, the federal government is actively working on a nationwide legalization framework.</p>

      <p>In summer 2025, the Federal Council submitted a draft law for public consultation. This proposal outlines how cannabis could be legally sold and consumed for recreational use by adults. The model focuses on strict regulation, health protection, and market control.</p>

      <p>The proposed law includes the following key points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adults aged 18 and above can legally possess and consume cannabis.</li>
        <li>Sales will be allowed through licensed shops with strict quality control.</li>
        <li>Home cultivation will be permitted, but limited to a certain number of plants per person or household.</li>
        <li>Advertising cannabis products will be prohibited.</li>
        <li>Products will have THC limits and mandatory labeling for health warnings.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The consultation phase allows cantons, political parties, organizations, and the public to provide feedback. Based on this input, the law may be revised before it's submitted to Parliament for final approval.</p>

      <p>If passed, the law could come into effect in 2026 or 2027. It would replace the current legal framework where cannabis is illegal except in tightly regulated medical or pilot project settings.</p>

      <p>Switzerland already runs several pilot projects where selected participants can legally purchase cannabis in cities like Zurich and Basel. These are scientific studies meant to assess the impact of legalization.</p>

      <p>This new national approach is not just about access—it’s also about prevention, health, and education. The draft includes funding for youth protection programs and campaigns about responsible use.</p>

      <p>Until the law is passed, most cannabis-related activities remain illegal. That means growing, selling, or possessing cannabis without being part of a pilot project can lead to fines or charges. However, personal possession of small amounts (under 10g) for private use has been decriminalized and usually results in a fine of 100 CHF.</p>

      <p>For the latest updates, always check official federal websites or trusted Swiss news sources. Things are changing fast, and new developments may occur throughout 2025 and beyond.</p>
