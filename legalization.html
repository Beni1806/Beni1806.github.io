      <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Current Cannabis Legalization Status in Switzerland</h2>

      <p>
        In 2025, Switzerland is taking concrete steps toward legalizing cannabis for recreational use. Following years of political discussion, pilot projects, and scientific evaluation, the federal government has drafted a new framework aimed at allowing controlled cannabis use among adults.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Federal Council has submitted this draft to the formal consultation process (Vernehmlassung), which involves collecting input from cantons, political parties, civil society groups, and experts. This draft outlines how a national legal market for cannabis could function while prioritizing health protection and minimizing illegal trade.
      </p>

      <p>
        The proposed law includes legal possession of small amounts (up to 10 grams for adults), regulated production and sale through licensed shops, quality standards, and clear rules about advertising bans, packaging, and product limits. A national licensing system would control who can produce and sell cannabis, and regular inspections would ensure compliance.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the central goals is to take cannabis out of the black market and into a regulated environment. By doing so, the government aims to better protect consumers, reduce crime related to illegal sales, and gain public tax revenue that can be invested in prevention and education.
      </p>

      <p>
        The new law would include strong youth protection measures, such as an age limit of 18, and strict penalties for violations. There would also be public education campaigns to inform users about risks and responsible use. In addition, data collection and ongoing research are planned to monitor the impact of legalization on society and health.
      </p>

      <p>
        The consultation process is expected to last several months. After that, adjustments may be made to the draft based on the feedback received. The final version of the law would then need to be approved by Parliament, and potentially by public referendum if enough opposition arises.
      </p>

      <p>
        If all goes as planned, a regulated cannabis market could become reality in Switzerland within the next couple of years. However, until the law is passed and implemented, possession and distribution outside of pilot projects remain illegal under current law.
