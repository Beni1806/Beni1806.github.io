      <p>
        The Swiss Federal Council (Bundesrat) is actively working on cannabis legalization. In the summer of 2025, it plans to submit a new draft law for public consultation (Vernehmlassung). This is an important step in the process, allowing authorities, experts, and the public to give feedback before the law is finalized.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed law aims to regulate the production, sale, and consumption of cannabis for adults in a controlled and responsible way. It focuses on public health, youth protection, and reducing illegal trade. The draft also includes rules for licensing producers and retailers, quality control, and taxation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, cannabis with more than 1% THC remains illegal in Switzerland, but possession of small amounts is often tolerated in some cantons. CBD products with less than 1% THC are legal and widely available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Federal Council’s initiative reflects changing public opinion and international trends towards cannabis legalization. If the law passes, Switzerland will become one of the first European countries with regulated recreational cannabis.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the process still requires approval from the parliament and possibly a public referendum. So while progress is being made, the legal status of cannabis remains in transition.
