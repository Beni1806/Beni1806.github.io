      <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Current Cannabis Legalization Status in Switzerland</h2>

      <p>
        In 2025, Switzerland is undergoing significant steps toward cannabis legalization. After years of discussion and research,
        the Federal Council has moved forward with plans to modernize cannabis laws and introduce regulated frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        This summer, the Federal Council officially submitted a draft law to the consultation process. This draft aims to legalize
        the possession and regulated sale of cannabis for adult recreational use. The law is designed to balance public health,
        safety, and personal freedoms while limiting the black market.
      </p>

      <p>
        Key points of the proposed law include legal possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis for personal use, allowing licensed
        stores to sell cannabis under strict conditions, and setting limits on THC content in products. The law also includes
        measures for consumer protection, such as age restrictions (minimum 18 years), advertising bans, and quality controls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The consultation phase involves feedback from cantons, interest groups, health experts, and the public. This process typically
        lasts several months and may lead to changes before the law is finalized. If approved, the new cannabis regulations could
        come into effect within the next couple of years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the draft law promotes research on cannabis effects and encourages prevention campaigns to educate the public
        about responsible use and potential risks. Medical cannabis regulations will remain separate but continue to be supported
        by the government.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this progress, cannabis possession and sale outside this regulated framework remain illegal under current Swiss law.
        Users and growers should stay informed about the changing legal landscape to ensure compliance.
      </p>

        Swiss government websites and trusted news sources.
