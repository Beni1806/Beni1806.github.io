      <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Current Legalization Status</h2>
      <p>
        Switzerland is in the middle of a major shift in cannabis policy. While medical cannabis has been legal under prescription since 2022, recreational cannabis remains illegal, though small quantities (under 10 grams) have been decriminalized for personal use. However, things are changing quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summer 2025, the Swiss Federal Council is expected to submit a draft cannabis law to a public consultation process ("Vernehmlassung"). This process allows cantons, political parties, experts, and the public to comment on the proposed legislation before it goes to parliament. The planned law aims to create a legal framework for the controlled production, distribution, and use of cannabis by adults.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to preliminary outlines, the new law would allow licensed retailers to sell cannabis under strict conditions. These would include maximum THC limits, packaging regulations, advertising bans, and purchase limits. The legal age for buying cannabis will likely be set at 18 or 21. Personal cultivation may also be regulated — for example, permitting a limited number of plants per adult.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major goal of the reform is to combat the black market. By introducing legal alternatives, the government hopes to improve consumer safety, reduce criminal involvement, and collect useful data on cannabis consumption. The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) is leading this effort, supported by findings from existing pilot projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        These pilot projects, launched in cities like Zurich, Basel, and Lausanne, allow selected residents to legally purchase cannabis in pharmacies or special dispensaries. The data from these trials is being used to inform future regulations. They examine how legal access affects consumption habits, mental health, and the illegal market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upcoming consultation is just the beginning. Once the public feedback is collected, the government may revise the draft law. Then, it will be submitted to Parliament, where it will go through both chambers (Nationalrat and Ständerat). If approved, the law could take effect as early as 2026 — but this depends on political consensus and possible referendums.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, Switzerland is not yet fully legalizing cannabis, but is actively working toward a regulated adult-use market. The goal is a safer, more transparent system that balances health protection, individual freedom, and public interest.

        We will update this page as the legalization process develops, including key dates, changes in the law draft, and how you can participate in the consultation or stay informed.
