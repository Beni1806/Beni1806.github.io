      <p>
        In recent years, cannabis policy in Switzerland has seen significant developments. The Federal Council (Bundesrat) is actively addressing cannabis regulation, and this summer it is expected to launch a consultation process for a new cannabis law.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposed law aims to regulate the controlled distribution of cannabis for adult recreational use under strict conditions. The goal is to reduce illegal trafficking, improve consumer protection, and promote public health by enforcing quality controls and setting age limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, possession of small amounts of cannabis (up to 10 grams) is decriminalized in most Swiss cantons but still subject to fines. Medical cannabis is legal under prescription, and pilot projects for legal sales are underway in some cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upcoming consultation period will allow citizens, organizations, and cantons to provide feedback on the draft law before it proceeds to parliament. This marks a crucial step in Switzerland's efforts to modernize cannabis policy and adapt to changing societal attitudes.
